# One Hour Game Jam

## About

One Hour Game Jam is an event focused on making a game in just 1 hour from the moment the theme is announced. Yes, the timer starts ticking as soon as you begin brainstorming ideas! It is organized by [HyperGameDev](https://hypergamedev.itch.io/). Here are some of my attempts, each folder is titled with the date and title of the jam. Inside each folder, you'll find an HTML file that allows you to play the game right away in the browser, along with the game code and assets. I create my games using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel?tab=readme-ov-file) because I enjoy working with it.

### Description

Gamble is a dice game with combat mechanics. During your turn, you select the dice you want to roll with your mouse, then press "Roll" to roll them. When you "Pass," you deal damage equal to the dice result. You can gamble and try to reroll any number of your dice as many times as you'd like, but there's a twistâ€”if the new sum of your dice is lower than the previous sum, you lose your turn and deal no damage. During the enemy's turn, they just roll their dice, deal damage to you, and pass.
