### Description

Gamble is a dice game with combat mechanics. During your turn, you select the dice you want to roll with your mouse, then press "Roll" to roll them. When you "Pass," you deal damage equal to the dice result. You can gamble and try to reroll any number of your dice as many times as you'd like, but there's a twistâ€”if the new sum of your dice is lower than the previous sum, you lose your turn and deal no damage. During the enemy's turn, they just roll their dice, deal damage to you, and pass.
